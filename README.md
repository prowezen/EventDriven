# Project Management System

## Description
This Project Management System is a Java-based application designed to help event organizers manage project requirements, such as project proposals and budgets. It allows users to register, log in, create projects, assign requirements to different users, upload files for each requirement, and track the status of these requirements. The system utilizes an event-driven architecture to ensure modularity and responsiveness.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Users can register as either organizers or contributors and log in to the system.
- **Project Creation**: Organizers can create new projects and assign other users as organizers.
- **Requirement Assignment**: Organizers can assign specific requirements to users, set due dates, and track the status.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload files for their assigned requirements.
- **Status Tracking**: Track the status of each requirement (pending, submitted, reviewed, approved).
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The system uses event-driven architecture to handle updates and notifications efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The main programming language used.
- **Swing**: For creating the graphical user interface.
- **MySQL**: For the database to store user, project, and requirement data.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: To manage interactions between different components of the system.
